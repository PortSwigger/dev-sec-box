<p>DevSecBox is a powerful extension that bridges the gap between security testing and DevSecOps automation. It acts as a command-line adapter for macOS, Linux, and Windows, allowing you to execute shell commands, PowerShell scripts, compiled programs, and moreâ€”all from within its integrated environment. Designed for flexibility, it enables seamless integration with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, LXC, nmap, and even AI-powered utilities. Whether you're building one-off testing scripts or orchestrating complex, multi-step workflows, DevSecBox helps you visualize and automate your processes with ease.</p>

<p>The extension features a drag-and-drop workflow editor, live and manual execution modes, and advanced request/response handling tools. JSON manipulation, spoofing, and automated triggers make it ideal for security testing in microservice and CI/CD environments. It also supports compliance efforts by maintaining audit trails and enforcing security policies. With DevSecBox, teams can shift security left, enabling early detection and collaboration across development, operations, and security functions.</p>
