<p>DevSecBox is a comprehensive workflow orchestration extension that transforms security testing by providing a visual, drag-and-drop interface for building complex automation chains. It functions as a command-line adapter, enabling execution of shell scripts, PowerShell commands, and external programs directly from HTTP traffic analysis. The extension creates dynamic workflows through interconnected components called Triggers, Catchers, Senders, Spoofers, and Solvers, allowing security professionals to automate everything from simple data transformations to multi-step vulnerability discovery processes.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create a workflow by right-clicking in the DevSecBox panel and selecting <code class="InlineCode">Trigger</code> to establish the entry point for your automation chain.</li>
  <li>Add <code class="InlineCode">Catcher</code> components to process incoming HTTP data, using the colored placeholder buttons to insert request/response fields into your shell commands or scripts.</li>
  <li>Configure processing logic in each Catcher's <code class="InlineCode">in</code> tab using shell syntax, PowerShell commands, or JSON transformations, with data flowing between connected components through <code class="InlineCode">out</code> tabs.</li>
  <li>Use the <code class="InlineCode">Sender</code> component to make custom HTTP requests based on processed data, and the <code class="InlineCode">Spoofer</code> component to replace specific content in responses.</li>
  <li>Add a <code class="InlineCode">Solver</code> component in Live mode to automatically generate structured vulnerability reports from your workflow output using predefined JSON formats.</li>
  <li>Test workflows manually by right-clicking requests in <code class="InlineCode">Proxy</code> history and selecting <code class="InlineCode">Send to DevSecBox</code>, or enable <code class="InlineCode">Live Workflow</code> mode for automatic processing.</li>
  <li>Configure concurrency settings, timeouts, and thread limits using the <code class="InlineCode">booster</code> tab to optimize performance for your specific use case.</li>
  <li>Use the context menu options for JSON import/export, search/replace functionality, and workflow testing with mock data.</li>
</ol>
