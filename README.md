# DevSecBox Extension for Burp Suite

</div><p align="center"><img src="src/main/resources/DSB.PNG" alt="DevSecBox" width="100%"></p>

## Overview

**DevSecBox** is a cutting-edge extension for Burp Suite that serves as a powerful orchestrator for Bug Hunters and DevSecOps tasks. It acts as an adapter for your macOS, Linux, or Windows command line, allowing you to run shell scripts, PowerShell scripts, or any program, and even compile code in any language directly from its environment. This makes it a breeze to integrate with a ton of DevSecOps tools like AI, Kubernetes, LXC, Docker, nmap, and other utilities. It autonomously kicks off and manages complex security workflows, offering virtually limitless possibilities limited only by your imagination.
